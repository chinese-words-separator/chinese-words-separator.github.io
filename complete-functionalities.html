Latest version (optimizations):

* Optimized the words separator's processor, it is now using just a 160 KB memory lookup to perform a task.
In the past, it was reading the word's HSK level from a big file which causes the words separator memory consumption to spike up to 100 MB; now the words HSK level info is embedded directly into the code, which is just 160 KB in size

* Optimized memory footprint for CWS's dictionary, it can now be just 26 MB.
CWS's dictionary can now be made significantly more lightweight than other dictionaries despite CWS having over 180K words (others have 120K words). This can be made possible by making CWS read the dictionary from the database instead of from file. To configure CWS to read the dictionary from the database instead of from file, go to CWS's Options screen and click the button labeled *Save the dictionary to database*. With database use, the dictionary's memory footprint will be reduced from 108 MB down to 26 MB

    Other file-based dictionaries' memory footprint:
    * Zhongwen: 42 MB
    * LiuChan: 82 MB
    * Inkah: 76 MB
    * Zhongzhong: 45 MB
