8.24.84.2222:
FIX: Dictionary, character that was being shown as variant is just similar to original. This is fixed now, the similar character is not shown anymore

An example:

Before (incorrect):
纔
cái 才 (variant of 才[cai2]) just now｡ (variant of 才[cai2]) (before an expression of quantity) only

After (correct):
纔
cái (variant of 才[cai2]) just now｡ (variant of 才[cai2]) (before an expression of quantity) only

8.24.84.2221:
FIX: Dictionary, definition was showing even when its variant is incorrect. This is fixed now

An example:

When `Show both traditional and simplified` is checked, it is showing these definitions:
尝
cháng 嘗 to taste､ to try (food)｡ to experience｡ (literary) ever､ once 
cháng 嚐 to taste､ to experience (variant of 嘗|尝[chang2])
cháng 甞 old variant of 嘗|尝[chang2]

When `Show both traditional and simplified` is unchecked, it was showing the following definitions (which is incorrect):
尝
cháng to taste､ to try (food)｡ to experience｡ (literary) ever､ once 
cháng to taste､ to experience (variant of 嘗|尝[chang2])

The `cháng to taste､ to experience (variant of 嘗|尝[chang2])` should not be shown; as it seems that `尝` is the variant, when the variant is actually `嚐`

Thus when `Show both traditional and simplified` is unchecked, it should show the following only:
尝
cháng to taste､ to try (food)｡ to experience｡ (literary) ever､ once

8.24.84.2181:
FIX: Hoverless video dictionary, the English annotation was just based on the definition from the first pinyin of hanzi, this produces erroneous English annotation if the hanzi has many pinyin readings, e.g., 长. This is fixed now, the English annotation is now chosen based on hanzi's pinyin annotation. That is if 长 is cháng, the English annotation will be from `length｡ long｡ forever｡ always｡ constantly`; and if 长 is zhǎng, the English annotation will be from `chief｡ head｡ elder｡ to grow｡ to develop｡ to increase｡ to enhance`
FIX(Mobile): Dictionary, should not reposition when calligraphy is dynamically added

FIX: Dictionary, when the dictionary is at the bottom of page, and when a word with big content is dynamically added to dictionary, thus making the bottom part of the dictionary not visible to user, then the dictionary the needs be to resized and re-positioned above the hovered word/sentence, this makes dictionary disappear. In the past, to prevent the dictionary from disappearing, we do not make it reposition to top, and we just simply resize the dictionary to small size so the dictionary will still be visible to user and then just add scrollbar to it. The drawback of the aforementioned approach is that the dictionary's available area for content is so cramped. This is fixed now (finally), the dictionary can now be safely resized to the total height of the content and can be safely re-positioned above the hovered word/sentence without making the dictionary disappear

Until a good solution is found, some text on YouTube will not get pinyinified nor colorized for the time being

各位 平常 到 超商 都 买 什么 呢

TODO: Make the correction list configurable or pull the data from a server so whenever there are new corrections, there is no need to re-deploy to Chrome web store

Currently, the correction list is hardcoded:

// 各位平常到超商都买什么呢
商都: ['超'],
};

Advanced: Hanzi 1.25x, rotating colors, exclude learned words from color, on-demand word dictionary
Expert: Hanzi 1x, on-demand word dictionary

FIX: When on-demand word dictionary is used in text boxes, the dictionary does not disappear when moving the mouse cursor away from the text, must hover the mouse in the dictionary first and then move the mouse cursor away from the dictionary so the dictionary will disappear. This is fixed now, it is no longer required to hover the mouse cursor on the dictionary first when making the dictionary disappear, the dictionary will disappear when mouse cursor is moved away from either text or dictionary

This is fixed now, navigation should only work when the dictionary is visible

FIX: Hanzi color is not showing in youdao. Fixed now

7.1.0: 
NEW: Proofreading mode. Example use, when writing in HTML-based word processors, or when composing emails. With proofreading mode, pinyin/guides and spaces for hanzi are turned off, hanzi's size is restored to its original size, hanzi's color is reverted to original, and the dictionary is set to *sentence pop-up dictionary* (as opposed to *word pop-up dictionary*) in order to minimize hovering on Chinese words while proofreading; proofread more, hover less. All dictionary mode works while proofreading except *sentence inline dictionary*, just switch to other dictionary mode when dictionary mode is unintentionally (no harm on document) set to *sentence inline dictionary* 

NEW: Beginner mode. When beginner mode is activated, hanzi size is set to 2x bigger, pinyin is shown, characters tones are color-coded (using Pleco-based tones color scheme, can be changed to modified Hanping-based tones color scheme by clicking the Chinese words separator's icon on the browser's toolbar), space is added between words, words are automatically read-aloud when hovered. To activate beginner mode, right click Chinese words separator icon on the browser's toolbar, select Tools > select Beginner mode.

NEW: Quick way to turn the dictionary on/off. To assign a shortcut, click the puzzle icon on the browser's toolbar, select Manage Extensions > select 'burger' menu on top left > click Keyboard shortcuts, then set the shortcut in: Dictionary quick on/off

UPDATE: When Alt or option key (mac) is used in sentence dictionary or on-demand word dictionary, the word/on-demand dictionary immediately disappears after moving the mouse when Alt or option key is released. That flaw is fixed now. Holding the Alt or option key (mac) is no longer required to keep the dictionary window open, thus accessing functionalities such as read-aloud, google translate, bing translate is not cumbersome anymore, likewise with activating functionalities via keyboard shortcut such as 'c' (for copy definitions), and 's' for read-aloud

FIX: On-demand word dictionary still checks for hotkeys (e.g., read-aloud hotkey and character dictionary hotkey) despite moving the mouse cursor out of Chinese text. This is fixed now, hotkeys are only activated when the dictionary is active

UPDATE: Dictionary, new definitions

7.0.0:
NEW: Print calligraphy to printer or PDF. To use, right-click Chinese words separator's icon on the browser's toolbar, select Tools > Print

UPDATE: When *Exclude learned words from color* is active, and unintentional clicks often happen, the learner can disable the clicks by un-ticking the *Click to mark learned words* checkbox in the Options screen. Consequently, to mark words as learned, use right click's menu instead, then select Chinese words separator.

FIX: Corrected the hanzi frequency optimization

6.10.1:
OPTIMIZATION: 
* Updating of hanzi's frequency now performs fewer I/O operations
* When whole page is detected as non-Chinese, text nodes are not processed

FIX: Frames of calligraphy strokes is not aligned on a site. This is fixed now

6.10.0:
NEW: When letter s (default shortcut key for text-to-speech, a.k.a. read-aloud) is pressed the second, third  time around (and so on), it will make the succeeding sound be played at 80% of the previous speed. The sound will revert to its original speed 3 seconds (not too short, not too long) after the last press of letter s, or when listening to new word/phrase/sentence. If need to always start at 80% or 70% of the normal speed when speech is played, set the read-aloud speed to 20% slower or 30% slower respectively in the Options screen.

UPDATE: Made alert, confirmation, input dialogs (e.g., pinyin input for learned words) look better

UPDATE: Sentence dictionary now shows each phrase instead of the whole sentence. Less scrolling

UPDATE: Dictionary's bigger font size, the difference between bigger (23px) and non-bigger (20px) was too minimal. Changed the dictionary's bigger font size from 23px to 30px

FIX: Sentence dictionary and word dictionary sometimes appear at the same time. This is fixed now. When changing dictionary mode, the previous dictionary mode is immediately deactivated

FIX: Single character shortcuts were activating even when modifier keys are used, e.g., spreadsheet-compatible copy (letter c) is activating when Ctrl+C is used. This is fixed now, single key shortcuts activate only when a single key is pressed.

6.9.0
UPDATE: Added shadow to notification's box

FIX: When using dictionary on input box, text that wraps to new lines was rendering as just one whole line. This is fixed now, dictionary is now working on text that wraps in input box

FIX: There was no feedback if the microphone access was blocked when language learner is marking learned words with voice method. This is fixed now, user is notified to allow access to microphone first when learned words are to be verified with voice method

NEW: On learned words verification using pinyin input, when the language learner includes the tone number to pinyin input, the verification will be strict. This is useful if the language learners want to drill the word's tone to their memory when learning the word's tone via pinyin

Example:
电脑 dian4 nao3

If the learner did not add any tones:
 
dian nao

the verification will be non-strict. The clicked 电脑 will be marked as learned.

However, if the learner added tones, e.g.,
dian4 nao4

the verification will be stricter, 电脑 will not be marked as learned

Likewise, dian4 nao, will not mark 电脑 as learned. Strict verification applies to whole word, not to each syllable.

To be stricter with neutral tone on single character word, add 5 to it, e.g.,
妈 ma1

If the learner thought 妈 is ma5 and typed ma5, the verification will be strict, thus 妈 will not be marked as learned. If the learner thought it is ma5, but merely typed ma instead, the verification will be non-strict, thus 妈 will be marked as learned even if 妈's tone is 1.

For multiple character words with neutral tone, e.g., 什么 shen2 me5. Both of these can mark 什么 as learned word:
shen2 me5
shen2 me

6.8.0
NEW: Dictionary might not work when hovering over the characters that are in text boxes. When this happen, press *Alt* or *option key* (mac) first, then hover the mouse cursor on Chinese character. The dictionary can be used to proofread what you typed

6.7.0
NEW: Sentence mining sites can now be accessed quickly with single key shortcuts. There are 12 default sentence mining sites, the first nine can be accessed quickly by pressing 1 to 9. These shortcuts can also be changed in the Options screen
FIX: Some site affected the paragraph's padding of the dictionary's window. This is fixed now

6.6.0 NEW: Sentence mining sites can now be selected from context menu. Random mining (🎲 I'm feeling lucky) is still available

To select a specific sentence mining site, after selecting a word, right-click mouse, select:

    Mine sentences to tab for “东西” from >
        www.bing.com
        youdao.com
        youglish.com

Sentence mining site is configurable in Options, can delete or add more sentence mining sites

6.5.0
NEW: Font selection for Chinese characters

Changing font for Hànzi takes effect on Chinese text only. Other languages' text (aside from pīnyīn/guide) will not be affected when hànzi's font is changed. Only when the pīnyīn/guide's font is set to *Same as Hanzi* that the pīnyīn/guide will have the same font as the Chinese text

FIX: Some characters have incorrect type (traditional vs simplified). This is fixed now

6.4.0 NEW: Clipboard functionalities
To access, right click the Chinese words separators' icon on the browser's toolbar, then select from the following:

    Clipboard >
        Separate words with spaces
        Traditional to Simplified
        Simplified to Traditional

Limitation: Can't be used while in Options screen, or when the active tab is a blank tab, or when the tab is fully controlled by an extension (think Momentum)

Must allow access to clipboard when prompted

6.3.0: UPDATE: Conversion (simplified <-> traditional) is now working instantly, no need to reload the page.

Aside from being able to instantly convert pages system-wide from the Options screen, instant conversion can also be used on as-needed basis. When need to convert a specific site, right click Chinese words separators' icon on the browser's toolbar, then select from the following actions:

    Page: Revert to original characters
    Page: Traditional to Simplified
    Page: Simplified to Traditional

6.2.0 NEW: Copy dictionary's definitions to clipboard.
Shortcuts:
c: Copy the definitions in the same order the words appear
C: Copy the definitions as sorted by pīnyīn

Definitions is copied to clipboard as tab-delimited, this is spreadsheet-compatible

6.1.0 NEW: Word dictionary mode
In contrast with on-demand word dictionary mode, the word dictionary mode does not require holding the Alt or option (mac) key

Default shortcuts for word dictionary mode:
a Next word
A Previous character
z Next character
s Read aloud (this also works in sentence dictionary)

If desired, the letters a and s can be pressed at the same time, this makes CWS read the word upon moving to next word

The shortcuts can be changed in Options

UPDATE: Made the pīnyīn in the dictionary color blue
UPDATE: Updated the HSK levels of the traditional characters
FIX: Inline dictionary does not disappear when the mouse cursor is outside the dictionary. This is fixed now

5.6.0
UPDATE: More words have HSK level now
FIX: Inline dictionary have wrong margin on certain site. This is fixed now

5.5.0
UPDATE: Added smaller and smallest sizes to Guide's size options. Some language learners might prefer to preserve the aesthetics of no space between hànzis when pīnyīn guide is added to the hànzi; the smallest size (and to some extent, smaller size; longest pinyin zhuang cannot fit in one hanzi when guide's size is smaller) can facilitate that aesthetics. The Guide's default size is small.
FIX: YouTube, the title and comments of previously watched Chinese video appeared on next  (non-Chinese) video. This is fixed now, the title and comments of the previous video does not carry over to the next video.
FIX: Some text have indentions when translated to sidebar/tab. This is fixed now, no more indentions

5.4.0
UPDATE: Additional Hanzi size options: 1.75x, 2.25x
UPDATE: Additional Chinese sentence mining sites
FIX: Some sites affects the layout of the Bing translator and Google translator icons' in the dictionary. This is fixed now
FIX: Sites with iframe has side effects (e.g., opening multiple tabs instead of just one) when using certain functionalities (e.g., Chinese sentence mining). This is fixed now

5.3.0 UPDATE: Additional Chinese sentence mining site

5.2.2 FIX: Box's height is short for garden-path on hànzi with with neutral tone mark (the hànzi's tone mark, not the pīnyīn's tone mark). This is fixed now, garden-path box for neutral tones mark has full height now

5.2.1 
FIX: Some websites affect the inline dictionary's text-indent. This is fixed now, websites can't affect dictionary's text-indent
Optimization

NEW: Additional font choices for guide/pīnyīn. Default font to Optima
NEW: Notification when hànzi's font size is changed via keyboard shortcut
FIX: When the dictionary is in pop-up mode and the page is scrolled, the dictionary keeps floating on screen. This is fixed now, the dictionary no longer floats on screen while scrolling

4.8.3 Minor enhancement: When dictionary's top goes above (which can't be seen) the screen, the dictionary's top is re-adjusted and the dictionary's height is shrank so there is no need to manually scroll up the page. However, it would still be best for the language learners to scroll up the page, then the dictionary will appear below the sentence instead, this will also give more screen real estate for the dictionary.

4.8.2 Minor enhancement: Adjusted dictionary's height so that if the sentence fits exactly in the sentence dictionary, the scrollbar won't appear

4.8.1 FIX: Pop-up dictionary sometimes go to the right edge of the browser. This is fixed now

4.8.0 NEW: Additional dictionary mode: On-demand word dictionary. For advanced Chinese language learners who occasionally need a dictionary, set the dictionary mode to *On-demand word dictionary*.

 * improved line spacing
NEW: Speaker emoji for read aloud in Chinese words separator's context menu 
FIX: Corrected reactivation of dictionary when using keyboard shortcut

4.4.2 HOTFIX: Names with dots received tones that are for the hànzi, this causes wrong tones for the last one or two hànzi, which gets displayed as undefined. This is fixed now. Dots receive neutral tone.

马丁・路德・金
Mǎ dīng_Lù dé_Jīn
We get tones from pīnyīn, the tones will be incorrect for the last one or two characters if non-Chinese characters (e.g., middle dot) grabs the tones that are for Chinese characters
3, 1, 4, 2, 1

The dot character after 丁, wrongly received fourth tone, it should be neutral tone. And the second dot received undefined

我的手指动不了了

wǒ de shǒuzhǐ dòng bù liǎoliǎo

should be:

wǒ de shǒuzhǐ dòng bùliǎo le

Optimize to garden-path that makes more sense

Fixed.

4.4.0
NEW: Read aloud

4.2.2 
FIX: Removed duplicate definitions

FIX: Minimize garden-paths confusion
不知道 was tokenized as 不知 道
Though the two words (不知 and 道) might makes sense too, 不 is usually used separately.
Just made the above be tokenized as 不 知道 instead

Likewise with 不清净
It was tokenized as 不清 净
It's now tokenized as 不 清净

For non-garden-path words, e.g., 不知书
It will not be tokenized as 不 知书
It will be tokenized as 不知 书

FIX: Made learning notification's size uniform on all sites

4.2.1
FIX: Excluded some (not all) repeating words from garden-path detection, e.g., 哈哈哈哈
FIX: Granular dictionary was not listing all possible words from a compound word/phrase when hovering the first hànzi of the compound word/phrase, 要不是 only shows 要不是 and 要. It does now, hovering over 要 of 要不是 now lists all of these: 要不是, 要不, 要
NEW: Changed the *Exclude hànzi-based links* to *Exclude hànzi-based links/buttons*. Some buttons have fixed heights too, height-affecting options such as Pīnyīn and Hànzi font size makes the page looks messy when the buttons' size are changed

4.2.0 
NEW: Detection of possible garden-path words. Garden-path words are enclosed in a box.
Garden-path: https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/17071/how-to-determine-the-end-of-words/17074#17074

UPDATE: Dictionary, new words

FIX: Removed duplicate definitions, examples of previous duplicates:

"gēng": [
    "to change or replace",

]

"shū pó": [
    "aunt by marriage",
    "husbands fathers younger brothers wife",
    "husband's aunt",
    "husband's father's younger brother's wife"
]

Removed:

    "husbands fathers younger brothers wife"

4.1.0 NEW: Can now use bigger font size for dictionary, this can be set in Options screen

4.0.1 UPDATE: Updated the complete HSK 1 to 6 example on Options screen. This allows the language learners to preview the colors they assigned for each HSK level even while on Options screen

4.0.0 NEW: Granular (phrase/word) dictionary

Default is sentence dictionary. Use granular dictionary if you need to lookup the meaning of the individual characters/words of compound words or phrases. To activate granular dictionary, hold the *alt* or *option* key while hovering the mouse on compound words or phrases

3.4.0 NEW: Dictionary settings can be previewed in Options screen. Can see the word's definition in word statistics

3.3.0 NEW: Added Google Translate. This translator can't be opened as sidebar in the page due to restriction on embedding Google Translate. Google Translate opens in a new tab instead. There's an icon in the dictionary that when clicked will use Google Translate in a new tab, or can be used when selecting Chinese text

3.2.0 NEW: Bing Translator. There's an icon in the dictionary that when clicked will use Bing Translator at the sidebar, or can be used when selecting Chinese text

3.1.0 NEW: When selecting text, on CWS context menu this is available: Copy with space. With that, the Chinese text that is copied will have a space between words

3.0.0 NEW: Dictionary

The dictionary for sentence can be inlined with the mouse-hovered sentence, this is the default. This can be changed to pop-up if the learner prefer this mode

2.11.0 NEW: Updated the dictionary. Added word boundary to compound words and phrases on pīnyīn that come from dictionary sources that has no word boundary on the pīnyīn of their compound words and phrases

Example
Simplified: 金窝银窝不如自己的狗窝
Traditional: 金窩銀窩不如自己的狗窩
English: There's no place like home

On the phrase above, though its hànzi is correctly colored/spaced as one phrase by Chinese Words Separator, its pīnyīn was treated as one word due to some dictionary sources having no word boundary on their pīnyīn. Thus it was displayed by Chinese Words Separator as:

jīnwōyínwōbùrúzìjǐdegǒuwō

and on some pop-up dictionaries:
jīn wō yín wō bù rú zì jǐ de gǒu wō

Now on the latest Chinese Words Separator, the pīnyīn phrase above now shows nicely as:

jīn wō yín wō bùrú zìjǐ de gǒuwō

Some pop-up dictionaries still displays it as "jīn wō yín wō bù rú zì jǐ de gǒu wō", it's up to the developers of other pop-up dictionaries to make their pīnyīn more readable by adding word boundary

Another example
Simplified: 麦金塔电脑 
Traditional: 麥金塔電腦
English: Macintosh Computer 

It was displayed as:
màijīntǎdiànnǎo

and on some pop-up dictionaries:
Mài jīn tǎ diàn nǎo

Now on the latest Chinese Words Separator, the pīnyīn above now shows nicely as:

Màijīntǎ diànnǎo

Likewise, some pop-up dictionaries still displays it as "Mài jīn tǎ diàn nǎo", it is up to the developers of other pop-up dictionaries to make their pīnyīn more readable by adding word boundary

2.10.0 NEW: When tagging learned words, it can now be verified by inputting the pīnyīn. This is not enabled by default, this can be changed in Options screen

2.9.0 NEW: Words or phrases that are commonly worded or phrased together are now grouped together, for instance, the following examples will be highlighted/spaced as a compound word or as one whole phrase, courtesy of CedPane's dictionary

超级电脑 = chāojí diànnǎo = supercomputer
联合创始人 = liánhé chuàngshǐ rén = co-founder
政策制定者 = Zhèngcè zhìdìng zhě = policymaker
游戏结束 = yóuxì jiéshù = game over
另类摇滚乐 = lìnglèi yáogǔnyuè = alternative rock music
应用程序接口 = yìngyòng chéngxù jiēkǒu = application programming interface
允许安装来自未知来源的应用 = yǔnxǔ ānzhuāng láizì wèizhī láiyuán de yìngyòng = allow installation from unknown sources

The above are available on traditional characters too

2.8.0: NEW: Updated the dictionary. Useful phrases and transliterated names from CedPane's dictionary are added to the dictionary. This dictionary has a good amount of useful phrases and transliterated names 

Many names and useful phrases can now be segmented correctly with Chinese Words Separator. This helps the language learners not to waste time analyzing enigmatic series of hànzi words; when in fact, put together, those hànzi words are just names of the people, likewise with compound words, colloquial phrases, and idioms
